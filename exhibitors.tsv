For the record, a big consumer of local products, those that I bought in local supermarkets were often qualitatively altered (salmonella, bacteria, etc.) due to poor packaging. From there our challenge was to put on the market a product with very high added value with adequate and protective packaging. This is how LOA was born with a Maam line which includes unique and innovative products.
The revaluation of our agricultural and forestry products is our credo and in this wake LOA, which is in a fair trade approach, works exclusively with GIEs of women processors to enable them to have the technical and organizational capacities to enable them to promote female leadership in the agro-industry sector."

One of the reasons for this is that devices like smartphones, which have limitations in accuracy, cannot be comfortably operated using conventional methods.

Therefore, we have developed several unique operation methods to overcome this problem, and have realized an interface that can operate a device with sufficient practicality even with a smartphone.

We have released ""Messay"", an eye-controlled alternative communication app, and ""Tube for Anyone"", an eye-controlled YouTube viewing app, and just recently released ""Mezic"", an app that allows the entire Android phone to be controlled with the eyes and face."

ORLIB Limited	ORLIB Limited is a university-launched venture developing high-energy batteries. We demonstrated a technology that dramatically increases energy density using active materials that reacts with multiple electrons. In particular, Si, has been attracting attention as a high-capacity anode material since it can react with 4 or more electrons, leading the significantly large capacity up to 4000 Ah/kg. However, Si has hardly been used because it has a large irreversible capacity, and a large volume change due to a charge/discharge reaction. ORLIB has developed the pressurized pre-doping technology to reduce irreversible capacity and the volume changes. Pre-doped Si, pSi, can be combined with various LIB cathodes to increase the energy by more than 1.5 times, making it possible to create high-energy batteries with low cost and rare metal-free LFP comparable to high energy LMNC.

REEV	When one in four people experience a stroke in their lifetime, the typical recovery path involves hospitalization, intense rehabilitation, and then returning home with limited mobility aids like leg braces, crutches, or wheelchairs. These passive solutions are outdated and can be very frustrating for patients. At REEV, we're transforming this approach with DREEVEN, a pioneering active and smart robotic knee brace designed to reduce muscle fatigue and restore confidence and freedom in daily movements. Unlike traditional braces that merely support the legs, DREEVEN is motorized and AI-powered to feel like having a new leg. Our technology, inspired by innovations in the automotive industry, is like 'power steering' for knees. While starting with stroke recovery, our broader aim is to revolutionize orthotic care with cutting-edge wearable robotics and AI, significantly enhancing patients' daily lives.

REFACT	Refact, our textile recycling technology is a game-changer in addressing the colossal 92 million tonnes of textile waste that are burnt or landfilled yearly. We can regenerate new viscose fibres from very poorly sorted to unsorted waste, with a particular focus on complex post-consumer waste, including multi-composition materials (minimum of 70% cellulosic content) and multi-coloured used garments with trims such as buttons, zippers, labels, etc. Our approach offers a significant and enduring impact on both environmental and economic fronts. By diverting a substantial portion of textile waste from landfills and incinerators, we drastically reduce the environmental footprint of the textile industry and alleviate pressure on natural resources. Canopy estimate that recycling just 25% of global pre- and post-consumer cotton and 25% of Manmade Cellulosic Fibres textile waste could replace all wood fibres (around 150 million trees per year) currently used in manufacturing MMCF/viscose.

RunBlind	"Today, the sound guidance of navigation applications is not adapted to real-time use. Users turn back to their screen,  which is dangerous and sometimes even prohibited.
Dynamic 3D audio guidance is the proposed alternative since it is natural to follow a sound source that precedes you, compensating for all head movements.
Such a solution has never seen the light of day before because it faces a major obstacle : the Bluetooth transmission of spatialized sounds in the phone introduces a latency that makes the guidance experience uncomfortable or even impossible. So, RunBlind’s spatialization technology is directly integrated into the microprocessors of the Bluetooth headsets (TWS) or smartglasses.

SIM2REAL	"One of the key components in the AI training is the training data. In particular, for the utilization of computer vision, appropriate images and corresponding label data are essential. However, there are several limitations to obtaining real-world image data. The quantity of data may be insufficient due to the infrequency of occurrences of real phenomena, or it may not exist at all. Even with easily accessible cases, personal information de-identification processes for data ethics or complex data labeling can consume significant human resources.
As a solution to these challenges, SIM2REAL proposes the acquisition of image and label data in a virtual simulation environment. This approach can achieve high quality, even distribution, evasion of personal information issues, and automated labeling. This is highly effective for anyone who want to develop and test a computer vision AI model and it can save a large amount of resources for AI training and testing."

Yet, 83% of them are not fitted with hearing solutions.
It leads to dozens of other pathologies, such as 8% of dementia cases.

Hearing loss has therefore been identified as a major health issue, with a $1,000 billion a year worldwide societal impact as estimated by the WHO.

How it works:

For wastewater, our modular plug & play systems fit seamlessly into existing operations. Units treat high-strength organic wastewater onsite, ensuring regulatory compliance and supporting sustainable energy goals. 

For more traditional AD systems, our next-gen biogas technology doubles feeding rates and increases methane yields by 30%."	Other	United Kingdom	30	Hors France

WasteAnt GmbH	The challenges that waste-to-energy plants face every day are diverse and require innovative solutions. There is no automatic system that can analyze high-volume material flows in real time for characteristics and ingredients. Hidden impurities can lead to drop chute blockages, and a lack of homogenization can lead to calorific value anomalies. WasteAnt offers sensor-based, AI-powered quality analysis for large-volume, unstructured waste streams. This creates a completely new level of transparency over waste streams, enabling waste management companies to make proactive decisions about waste treatment. By using various types of sensors in combination with system and ERP data, impurities can be identified, waste classification codes can be validated, characteristics such as homogeneity, chunkiness, dustiness and temperature can be evaluated, or calorific value and emission estimates can be created.

 _ It produces less food compared to modern farming methods, which can lead to food insecurity and poverty.
 _ It takes more time and labour to complete certain tasks, such as ploughing, weeding, harvesting, etc.
 _ It sometimes causes soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and chemical pollution, which can degrade the quality and fertility of the land. 
_ It involves deforestation and slash-and-burn activities, which can destroy natural habitats, biodiversity, and carbon sinks. 
_ It depends heavily on the season and climate, which can make it vulnerable to droughts, floods, pests, and diseases.

Witty Works	AI-plugin for inclusive language. Detect bias. Recruit faster, retain talent better. Build inclusive culture. Witty detects bias (also in LLMs) and supports to write inclusively real time. Analytics give insights on organizational unconscious bias.	HR/Training/Education	Switzerland	1	Hors France
Witty Works	"To be competititve, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is a must for companies. And yet, only 7% of CEOs of Europe's Fortune 500 are women. Worse, traditional business language deters diverse talent from applying. Studies show that 70% of job postings and employer branding content use language that does not attract people with diverse backgrounds. Biased wording at the workplace drives fluctuation.

Witty comes at rescue: An AI-augmented plugin (on browsers and Microsoft) supporting companies and their employees to implement inclusive language and behavior in real time. Witty detects biased wording and provides users with inclusive alternatives. It also provides micro-learning content about the bias behind the word. Not only do employees start to communicate more inclusively. They also take this newly learnt behavior into real life, fostering an inclusive corporate culture bottom up. Aggregating users' analytics, Witty provides insights into organizational unconscious bias."	HR/Training/Education	Switzerland	427	Hors France

Youngs Job	Youngs Job was launched in 2023 by 17-year-old Maxence. After being turned down for jobs out of fear, and seeing the growing demand for job offers, he created Youngs Job. It's the first platform to put employers in touch with young people aged 16 to 18. In practice, an employer posts an ad. It is classified. Young people consult the ads. The process to apply can help to create a CV. If the employer is interested, we help the young person with the administrative formalities. Once the paperwork has been checked, we put the company in touch with the young person. For young people, it's free! So they get a bigger offer than if they were looking locally. For the companies, it means they can find new employees who are motivated to find a job! Of course, the process is legal, so employers can rest assured! The cost to the employer is very low.
